# Seokkalae Banner and Icon
[Seokkalae Banner and Icon](../snippet/seokkalae-banner-and-icon.css) is a fork of [MinnerBanner](https://github.com/KuiyueRO/Obsidian-Miner/blob/main/md/MinerBanner.md), as the original repository has not been updated for a long time.

>⚠️ **IMPORTANT!**

>Some parts of the snippet have not been tested because I haven't used them (marked as **NEED TO TEST** in the CSS file).

## What's changed
- Removed the ability to create ***banner*** and ***icon*** using ***wikilink*** (it’s inconvenient, and callout has more functionality).
- Added support for image links.
- Added gradient settings.
- Added the ability to offset the main content from the ***banner*** and ***icon***. This is necessary so that ***bannericon*** (or any other ***icon*** not placed in a circle) does not overlap the main content.
- Improved support for `cssclasses: bannerimg`. In the original snippet, this style had almost no effect, but the ***snippet*** continued to function.
- Added ***PDF export*** support. Now ***banner*** and ***icon*** will appear in the PDF file.
- Added support for [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

## TODO
- Add examples
- Usage documentation (for now, the syntax is the same as [in the original repository](https://github.com/KuiyueRO/Obsidian-Miner/blob/main/md/MinerBanner.md))
